Regression
Regression is used to predict outputs that are continuous. The outputs are quantities that can be flexibly determined based on the inputs of the model rather than being confined to a set of possible labels.

For example:

Predict the height of a potted plant from the amount of rainfall
Predict salary based on someone’s age and availability of high-speed internet
Predict a car’s MPG (miles per gallon) based on size and model year

Classification
Classification is used to predict a discrete label. The outputs fall under a finite set of possible outcomes. Many situations have only two possible outcomes. This is called binary classification (True/False, 0 or 1, Hotdog / not Hotdog).

For example:

Predict whether an email is spam or not
Predict whether it will rain or not
Predict whether a user is a power user or a casual user

LINEAR REGRESSION
Minimizing Loss
The goal of a linear regression model is to find the slope and intercept pair that minimizes loss on average across all of the data.

The interactive visualization in the browser lets you try to find the line of best fit for a random set of data points:

The slider on the left controls the m (slope)
The slider on the right controls the b (intercept)
